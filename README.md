## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18 or higher
- [MySQL 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) or higher
- [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neema-dbms.git
cd neema-dbms

# 2. Install dependencies
cd neema-app
npm install

# 3. Set up the database (see Database Setup below)

# 4. Start the server
node server.js
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

---

## Database Setup

### Option A — Full Rebuild (Recommended)

Open MySQL Workbench and run:

```
File → Open SQL Script → neema_complete.sql → ⚡ Execute All
```

> ⚠️ This **DROPS** and recreates `neema_db` from scratch. All existing data will be lost.

### Option B — Step by Step

```sql
-- 1. Run base schema and data
SOURCE neema_complete.sql;

-- 2. Add more data (optional)
SOURCE neema_more_data.sql;

-- 3. Add bulk data (optional, 200+ rows per table)
SOURCE neema_bulk_data.sql;
```

### Before Running

In MySQL Workbench go to:
**Edit → Preferences → SQL Editor** → uncheck **"Safe Updates"** → reconnect.

### MySQL Users Created

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| `neema_admin` | `NeemaAdmin2026!` | Full access — all tables |
| `neema_manager` | `NeemaManager2026!` | CRUD on Employees, Projects, Incidents |
| `neema_employee` | `NeemaEmp2026!` | Read-only — views only |

---

## Running the App

```bash
cd neema-app
node server.js
```

Expected output:
```
Connected to neema_db
Neema running at http://localhost:3000
```

Then open:

| URL | Page |
|-----|------|
| `http://localhost:3000` | Login page |
| `http://localhost:3000/public.html` | Public portal |
| `http://localhost:3000/employee.html` | Employee dashboard |
| `http://localhost:3000/manager.html` | Manager dashboard |
| `http://localhost:3000/admin.html` | Admin dashboard |

---

```
POST   /api/{table}       → INSERT new record
PUT    /api/{table}/:id   → UPDATE record by ID
DELETE /api/{table}/:id   → DELETE record by ID
```

Where `{table}` is one of: `employees`, `projects`, `organizations`, `licenses`, `incidents`, `donors`, `research`, `audits`

## Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Error 1054: Unknown column 'Branch'` | Wrong column name — it's `BranchID` | Use `BranchID INT` not `Branch ENUM` |
| `Error 1064: Syntax error near 'ang'a'` | Apostrophe in `Ng'ang'a` breaks SQL | Escape as `Ng''ang''a` |
| `Error 1175: Safe update mode` | UPDATE without WHERE key column | Disable Safe Updates in Workbench Preferences |
| `Error 1396: CREATE USER failed` | User already exists | Add `DROP USER IF EXISTS` before `CREATE USER` |
| `Error 1452: FK constraint fails` | Inserting child before parent | Add `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0` before bulk insert |
| `node: command not found` | Node.js not in PATH | Reinstall Node.js and restart terminal |
| `Cannot find module` | Running `node server.js` from wrong folder | `cd neema-app` first |

## What I Learned

This project was built as a hands-on learning experience covering:

**MySQL**
- Relational schema design with foreign keys and ENUM constraints
- Self-referencing relationships (employee → manager)
- Many-to-many junction tables (ProjectTeam, ProjectFunding)
- Views as stable report interfaces
- Stored procedures with DECLARE, IF/ELSEIF, multiple result sets
- User-defined functions with DETERMINISTIC, READS SQL DATA
- User creation and privilege management (least privilege principle)
- Bulk data generation and import strategies
- INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries for dynamic schema management
- BLOB storage with FROM_BASE64() for binary data

**Node.js & Express**
- REST API design (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE → SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Parameterised queries to prevent SQL injection
- Middleware pattern (express.json(), express.static())
- Error handling with try/catch and HTTP status codes
- The DRY helper function pattern

**JavaScript**
- async/await and Promise.all for parallel API calls
- DOM manipulation for dynamic table rendering
- Real-time search with Array.filter()
- Template literals for HTML generation
- Event listeners and form handling
- Client-side role-based routing

**HTML & CSS**
- CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
- Flexbox split-screen layout
- Responsive design with media queries
- Modal forms without a framework
- Toast notifications
